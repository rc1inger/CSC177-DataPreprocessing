# CSC177-DataPreprocessing Project
The first assignment in the CSC 177: Data Mining and Analytics course

The focus of this assignment is on Data Preprocessing, a crucial step in the data mining process is given by selecting an unclean data set in order to revise it with Data Preprocessing. The project includes tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, transformation, and feature selection.

This repository will showcase our approach to handling raw datasets, applying preprocessing techniques, and preparing data for analysis. It serves as a resource for team members and a demonstration of our work in the field of data mining. In this repository, you will find detailed documentation of our preprocessing workflows, including data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction. Furthermore, our repository aims to encourage best practices in data handling and to serve as a reference for future projects.
